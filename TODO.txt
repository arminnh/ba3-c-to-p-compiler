files that didnt work but worked with gcc:
    *) matrixInverse, knapsackProblem, primsAlgorithm
    *) pointerReverseArray


*) pointer arithmetic
*) scanf and strings. For a scanf("%s", ...) statement, generate a loop of in c instructions. Exit the loop upon reading the escape character (ascii code 27).
*) a warning should be generated for variables which are initialized with themselves.

CODE GENERATION:
*) finish/check pointers (&(*aa);), *(f + 1) = 4;
*) static arrays + array subscripting
*) test all unary, binary and ternary operators
*) check argument loading for functions
*) check out how to handle void and void* type things
*) printf/scanf
*) check situations where there are multiple retfs in a row

EXTRAS:
*) implicit type conversions + warning (explicit done)
*) warning when variable declarations have no initializer
*) warning when overinitializing arrays
    maybe:
    *) check whether all paths in a function body end with a return statement
    *) dynamic arrays
    *) inline functions
    *) nested functions
